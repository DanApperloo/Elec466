How to Simulate SystemC Code...
To run SystemC you need to use one of the Linux machines in ELW B326: ugls1, ugls2, ..., ugls19.

To simulate xor2, for example, follow the seven steps outlined below.

1. Open a terminal window.

2. Create a new directory xor2 and change to it:

mkdir xor2
cd xor2

3. Put this Makefile into your xor2 directory.

4. Put xor2's SystemC source files (on this website) into your xor2 directory.

If you want to edit any of .h or .cpp files, type:

gedit filename.h &
or
gedit filename.cpp &

5. To compile SystemC files in your xor2 directory, type:

make all

6. To run SystemC executable code, called main.x, type:

./main.x

If you want to redirect the displayed output into a text file, type:

./main.x > filename.txt

7. To see simulation waveforms, type:

gtkwave xor2_traces.vcd

NOTE: When a waveform window comes up, it may show no signal waveforms. Click on "SystemC" to see the names of your traced signals. Then, select a signal whose wave you want to display and click on "Insert" button. Using "Edit -> Data Format" you can select how your signal is displayed (e.g., in binary, signed decimal, etc, if applicable).

How to Submit Your Code
Suppose you've been asked to submit your SystemC code for, say, Question 1 of Assignment 2. First, create a new directory for it, say, A2Q1. Then, create, compile, and simulate your design files in that directory. Don't forget to put this Makefile into A2Q1.

After your files have been finalized, remove by-products of editing, compilation, and execution, which can be done by typing:

make clean

Next, compress your directory A2Q1 by typing:

cd ..
tar -zcvf YourName_A2Q1.tar.gz A2Q1

NOTE: Your current directory (one level up from A2Q1) now contains the compressed file in question, e.g., JohnSmith_A2Q1.tar.gz.

Email your compressed file to daler@ece.uvic.ca.
